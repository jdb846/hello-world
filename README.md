# hello-world

Hello everyone.

My name is Joe. I'm looking to learn code, and eventually get into programming. I worked helpdesk for a while, and while it gave me a small glimpse into the world of IT, I have moved on to a different career path. After some curiosity, I have begun learning HTML, but I really think my brain is wired for programming. I enjoy the logic. If anyone has any tips on self-teaching yourself into a career of programming, such as starting in junior web development or junior programming positions, please send them my way!

I hope to hear from some of you!
